# Computer Security Project
## Evaluating the Performance and Security of Symmetric (AES), Asymmetric (ECC), and Hybrid (PGP) Encryption Algorithms 
The primary goal of this project is to evaluate and compare encryption algorithms based on their security, performance, and reliability. The focus will be on three categories of encryption algorithms: symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid. Through practical testing and detailed analysis, we aim to assess how each algorithm performs against various criteria and determine which are most suitable for specific use cases.
